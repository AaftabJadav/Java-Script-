Question 1: Explain the different types of loops in JavaScript (for, while, do-while). Provide abasic example of each.
ans:-

ðŸ”¹ Definition:
Loops in JavaScript are used to repeat a block of code multiple times, either for a fixed number of times or until a condition is met.

    ----- 1. for loop ----

ðŸ”¹ Definition:
Used when you know how many times you want to run the loop.

ðŸ”¹ Syntax:

for (initialization; condition; increment) {
  // code to run
}
ðŸ”¹ Example:

for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  console.log("Number:", i);
}
Output:

javascript
Copy
Edit
Number: 1
Number: 2
Number: 3
Number: 4
Number: 5

      ----  2. while loop ----

ðŸ”¹ Definition:
Used when you want to repeat code as long as a condition is true.

ðŸ”¹ Syntax:

while (condition) {
  // code to run
}
ðŸ”¹ Example:

let i = 1;
while (i <= 5) {
  console.log("While loop number:", i);
  i++;
}

            ---- 3. do-while loop ----

ðŸ”¹ Definition:
Same as while, but it runs at least once, even if the condition is false.

ðŸ”¹ Syntax:

do {
  // code to run
} while (condition);

ðŸ”¹ Example:
let i = 1;
do {
  console.log("Do-While number:", i);
  i++;
} while (i <= 5);


Question 2: What is the difference between a while loop and a do-while loop?

     ---- 1. while Loop ----

 - Condition is checked first.
 - Code runs only if the condition is true.
 - If condition is false in the beginning, code wonâ€™t run even once.
 
Example:
let i = 10;
while (i < 5) {
  console.log("Inside while loop");
}
// Output: nothing (condition is false

    ---- 2. do-while Loop ----

- Code runs first, then condition is checked.
- Always runs at least once, even if the condition is false.

Example:
let i = 10;
do {
  console.log("Inside do-while loop");
} while (i < 5);
// Output: Inside do-while loop (runs once)
