};
"name", "age", "isStudent" are keys (or properties)
"Amit", 25, true are values

-  Objects:

Objects store data in key-value pairs.
Each value has a name (key), like:

let person = {
  name: "Amit",
  age: 25,
  isStudent: true
};

  - Arrays:

Arrays store data in a list, using numbered positions (indexes):
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "mango"];
