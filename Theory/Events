Question 1: What are JavaScript events? Explain the role of event listeners
ans:-

Definition of JavaScript Events:
In JavaScript, events are actions or occurrences that happen in the browser — often triggered by the user.

--- For example:

- Clicking a button (click)
- Typing in an input box (keydown)
- Moving the mouse (mousemove)
- Page loaded (load)

--- What is an Event Listener?

An event listener is a function in JavaScript that waits for a specific event to happen, and then runs code in response.

It listens silently until the event happens — then it "reacts".

✅ Example:

<button id="myBtn">Click Me</button>

<script>
  // select the button
  let btn = document.getElementById("myBtn");

  // add an event listener to the button
  btn.addEventListener("click", function() {
    alert("Button was clicked!");
  });
</script>
