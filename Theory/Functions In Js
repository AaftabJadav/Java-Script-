Question 1: What are functions in JavaScript? Explain the syntax for declaring and calling a function.
ans:-

Definition:
- A function in JavaScript is a block of reusable code designed to perform a specific task

- Syntax :-

function functionName(parameters) {
  // code to be executed
}

- Syntax to Call a Function:

functionName(arguments);

ðŸ”¹ Example:

// Function Declaration
function greet(name) {
  console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
}

// Function Call
greet("Amit");
greet("Priya");

Output:
Hello, Amit!
Hello, Priya!

Question 2: What is the difference between a function declaration and a function expression?
ans:-

      --- 1. Function Declaration ---
Definition:
A function defined with the function keyword directly and independently.

Syntax:

function greet() {
  console.log("Hello!");
}
You can call it even before it's defined (hoisting).

    --- 2. Function Expression ---
Definition:
A function assigned to a variable. It can be named or anonymous.

Syntax:
 
const greet = function() {
  console.log("Hello!");
};
You cannot call it before it's defined.

Question 3: Discuss the concept of parameters and return values in functions

--- 1. What are Parameters? ----
Definition:

They are used when declaring a function.

Example:

function greet(name) {
  console.log("Hello, " + name);
}
greet("Amit"); // Output: Hello, Amit
Here, name is a parameter, and "Amit" is the argument passed during the function call.

--- 2. What is a Return Value? ---

Definition:

A function can return a value back to the place where it was called using the return keyword.
This value can be stored in a variable or used directly.

Example:

function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

let sum = add(5, 3);
console.log(sum); // Output: 8

- Here:
  a and b are parameters
return a + b; sends back the result
sum stores the return value
