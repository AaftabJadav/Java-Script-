Question 1: What is control flow in JavaScript? Explain how if-else statements work withan example.
ans:-

- Definition:
Control flow in JavaScript means the order in which code is executed in a program 

It helps us write logic:
“If this happens, do that... otherwise do something else.”

    --- If-else Statement ---

🔹 Definition:
if-else is a conditional statement that runs different blocks of code depending on whether a condition is true or false.

🔹 Syntax:
if (condition) {
  // runs if condition is true
} else {
  // runs if condition is false
}

🔹 Example:

let marks = 75;

if (marks >= 90) {
  console.log("Grade: A");
} else if (marks >= 75) {
  console.log("Grade: B");
} else if (marks >= 60) {
  console.log("Grade: C");
} else {
  console.log("Fail");
}

🔹 Output:

Grade: B
