Question 1: What are variables in JavaScript? How do you declare a variable using var, let,and const?
ans :- Variables are containers used to store data values in JavaScript

 1.var - var is  a global scope variable and its re-declared and updated 
 ex - var name = "Rahul";

2. const - const is a block scope variable and its not re-declared and not updated 
ex- const PI = 3.14;

3. let - let is a block scope variable and its not re-declared but updated
ex- let age = 25;


Question 2: Explain the different data types in JavaScript. Provide examples for each.

1. Primitive Data Types-:

         1. String
- Used to store text.
Example:
let name = "Rahul";

         2. Number

Example:
let age = 25;

          3. Boolean

            7. BigInt
Used for very large numbers.
Example:
let bigNum = 12345678901234567890n;

2. Non-Primitive Data Type :-

              8. Object
Used to store key-value pairs.
Example:

               9. Array
Used to store multiple values in a single variable.
Example:
let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];

               10. Function
