          --- JavaScript Error Handling Structure ---

JavaScript uses three main blocks for error handling:

1. try block:
Code that may throw an error is placed inside try.

2. catch block:
If an error occurs in the try, it’s caught and handled here.

3. finally block (optional):
This block runs no matter what — whether an error occurred or not. It’s used for cleanup code.

- Example:
try {
  let a = 10;
  let b = a + c;  // 'c' is not defined — this will cause an error
  console.log("This line won’t run.");
} catch (error) {
  console.log("An error occurred: " + error.message);
} finally {
  console.log("This runs no matter what.");
}

- Output:

An error occurred: c is not defined  
This runs no matter what.
