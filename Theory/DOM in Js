Question 1: What is the DOM (Document Object Model) in JavaScript? How does JavaScript interact with the DOM?
Ans:- 

- Defination :-
              The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface that represents the structure of a web page as a tree of objects. 

- How does JavaScript interact with the DOM?

- Select HTML elements by ID, class, tag name, or other selectors.
- Change the text or HTML inside an element.
- Modify the style of elements (like changing colors, size, visibility, etc.).
- Add new elements or remove existing ones from the page.
- Listen for events like clicks, form submissions, or key presses and respond to them with specific actions.

Question 2: Explain the methods getElementById(), getElementsByClassName(),and
querySelector() used to select elements from the DOM.

Ans-:

   ---- 1.getElementById() ----

This method is used to select a single element from the DOM using its unique ID.
It returns the first element that has the specified ID.

Example:
let title = document.getElementById("mainTitle");
This will select the element with the ID mainTitle.

    ---- 2. getElementsByClassName() ----
This method is used to select multiple elements that share the same class name.
It returns a collection (HTMLCollection) of elements, not a single one.

Example:
let items = document.getElementsByClassName("listItem");
This will select all elements with the class listItem.

    ---- 3. querySelector ----
This method is used to select the first element that matches a CSS selector (like class, ID, or tag).
Itâ€™s more flexible because it allows you to use complex selectors.

Example:
let firstButton = document.querySelector(".btn");
This will select the first element with the class btn.
